v0.4 - Added nonce/iv for key wrapping.  Dropped algorithms BlueDye, Wrzeszcz, the original ZanderFish.  Corrected key wrapping for Specjal at 512 and 1024 bit key lengths.  Replaced wrzeszcz_random with amagus_random.  This version is not backward compatible and is considered stable.

v0.4.1 - Add Zanderfish2 in OFB mode - 256 bit

v0.4.3 - Fix WildThing, Drop Ganja as a cipher, add ZanderFish3 256 bit, ZanderFish code cleanup

v0.4.4 - More code cleanup, Drop Wild and leave Spock as the only 128 bit cipher, Add ZanderFish2 CTR mode

v0.4.5 fix 0.4.4, Wild is still in the code base as the key wrapper for Spock

v0.4.6 - Fixed mixing algorithm in ZanderFish3 and tweak placement

v0.4.7 - Added some word swaps to ZanderFish3.  Should be the last change in the design.

v0.5 - New cipher designs for Amagus, Uvajda, Specjal and ZanderFish3.  Dieharder testing 100 iterations for each cipher and published the dieharder results in each cipher's repo.  Changed castlesmoke.py to clean up after itself.  Zander3 got a new mixing function and formula to calculate rounds based on key length.  Uvajda now uses an addition operation instead of XOR with the previous state.  Amagus has a transposition layer added. Specjal's round function was corrected.
