# DarkCastle

*** Warning the ciphers contained in this program are still undergoing cryptanalysis

*** Warning: this product is for non-production use.  If you want production level crypto, use OpenSSL or libsodium

DarkCastle is an authenticated file encryption program aiming to provide a large collection of community ciphers.  This program is intended for educational use until full cryptanalysis can be completed.

Please note these are one-shot encryption functions and will encrypt what you can fit into memory.

DarkCastle is accepting ciphers.  Email pvial00@gmail.com or open a github issue to submit/integrate a cipher, hash function, KDF or authentication method.

Complimenting DarkCastle is DarkPass, a password generator designed to give secure passwords compatible with DarkCastle.

*** Tested on MacOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, NetBSD
